# PyBer_Analysis
Analyze and visualize ride-sharing data using the capabilities of Python, Pandas and Matplotlib within Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Overview
Steps and Deliverables:
- Import your data into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Merge your DataFrames.
- Create a bubble chart that showcases the average fare versus the total number of rides with bubble size based on the total number of drivers for three city types.
- Determine the mean, median, and mode for the following:
  - The total number of rides for each city type.
  - The average fares for each city type.
  - The total number of drivers for each city type.
- Create box-and-whisker plots that visualize each of the following to determine if there are any outliers:
  - The number of rides for each city type.
  - The fares for each city type.
  - The number of drivers for each city type.
- Create a pie chart that visualizes each of the following data for each city type:
  - The percent of total fares.
  - The percent of total rides.
  - The percent of total drivers.

## Challenge Overview
This new assignment for you and Omar consists of three parts: two additional technical analyses and a written report that delivers your results to the CEO. To summarize, you will submit the following deliverables:
- Technical Analysis Deliverable 1: A DataFrame that summarizes the key metrics for the ride-sharing data by 
- Technical Analysis Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart, with one line for each city type, that shows the sum of the fares for each week.
- Delivering Results: A written report of your results, saved in a README.md document on your GitHub repository.
